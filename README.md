This is the KituraNet module for the Kitura project. Full details on the project can be found in the [main repo](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura).

The KituraNet module contains logic for sending and receiving HTTP requests. It also contains the structure for listening on a port and sending requests to a delegate for processing.

This package is dependent on the [KituraSys](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-sys) and [BlueSocket](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/BlueSocket) Swift packages.
